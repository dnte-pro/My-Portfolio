                <h4>ShuttleHub</h4>
                <p>I built and deployed ShuttleHub, a full-stack badminton court booking platform. The frontend was developed in React.js and the backend in Node.js with MongoDB. I containerized the app using Docker and deployed it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, enabling real-time booking with integrated payment support. This project helped me master containerization, cloud deployment, and CI/CD integration.

                    I developed a full-stack application that allows users to book appointments with vets online.
                    The application is built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
                    It has a fully functional dashboard that allows the vets to manage their appointments and carry out other
                    functions. The application also has a payment gateway that allows users to pay for their appointments online.
                    It is integrated with an AI chatbot that helps users navigate through the site.

                    This is the e-commerce project that I have worked on.
